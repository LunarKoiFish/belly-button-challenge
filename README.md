# belly-button-challenge

In module 14 Challenge, we are tasked with building an interactive dashbaord to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset using HTML and D3 library.

First we needed to use the D3 library to read the data in the json file before creating 2 different charts, bubble and bar charts. We then also created a display panel for the sample's metadata.

Though we are allowed to have our layout, I decided to stay simple and created a similar layout to the example given.

Once our app was created and all the files were pushed up into Git, we then deployed the app to a free static page hosting. I chose to use Github Pages as everything in this assignment can be accessed with Github. The link to the app is provided below as well submitted along with the link to this Git repo.



I consider this the second hardest challenge by far. This is due to my lesser experience with Javascript, and even less with the D3.js library. Due to my lesser experience, I did require more additional help from Xpert Learning Assistant and ChatGPT. I still used previous activities as a guide for this challenge, and then also used Xpert LA to refine and fix problems I had when the code did not work the way I wanted it to.
